And I begin to learn the web developing technologies and JavaScript programming, as since childhood I was interesting in computers, technologies, creations, mathematics, physics etc.</p><p>From the beginning it was just one of my hobbies, but very soon the interest to the web developing process become growing so fast, that I start think about it in professional side. And now, after almost 2 years of hard self-education, I decide to become a real specialist in the web development and programming, to be a part of cooperative and friendly team in the thriving Company, to develop some useful things for the people and constantly improve my personal and professional skills.</p><div class="row text-right"><dl><dt>Aleksey Kolyasa</dt><dd>- Odessa, 2017</dd></dl></div></div></div>
